# Austin Marron
I currently serve as the Chief Technology Officer of Aira, an innovative startup founded in 2015 with a goal to bridge the information gap for those with vision loss. My career includes leadership roles at some of the world’s most recognized technology companies, including Intuit and Blizzard Entertainment, where I am credited in franchises such as the incredibly successful World of Warcraft. I joined Aira in December of 2015 and lead product development efforts across hardware, software, and AI for Aira’s ever-growing community of Explorers. I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine.
